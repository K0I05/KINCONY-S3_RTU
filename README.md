The core development board uses the ESP32-S3-WROOM-1U N16R8 chip and compatible with Visual Studio Code and PlatformIO with ESP-IDF SDK.  The PlatformIO board that was selected is the `esp32s3box` given this board uses the same chip.  The core development board comes with RS485, I2C, 1-wire, and analog input ports and accepts a wide voltage range for the power supply (9-24VDC).  The analog input ports can use voltage or current signals which are set by jumpers. The board comes with an ethernet port and has support for the SIM7600 4G module and RF 433MHz receiver module.

The demo application interfaces the following sensors:
- RS2E radar precipitation sensor with temperature and humidity sensor (MODBUS RTU RS-485/12VDC)
- WDC2E ultrasonic anemometer (MODBUS RTU RS-485/12VDC)
- BMP280 atmospheric pressure and temperature sensor (I2C/3.3V)
- DS18B20 ground temperature sensor (1-Wire/3.3V)

The RS2E and WDC2E sensors are configured as MODBUS RTUs and interfaced to the core development board via the RS-485 port.  The BMP280 sensor is interfaced to the core development board via the I2C bus and the DS18B20 sensor is interfaced to the board via 1-wire input.  Information on ESP-MODBUS and component download is available here: https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-modbus/en/latest/esp32/.  And drivers for the BMP280 and DS18B20 are available here: https://github.com/K0I05/ESP32-S3_ESP-IDF_COMPONENTS.  

Before compiling the application be sure to download the ESP-MODBUS component and copy the component to the `components` folder.  Likewise, WiFi settings are configurable via the `network_connect.c` file located in the `src` folder.  Please see core development board GPIO mapping documentation (https://www.kincony.com/forum/showthread.php?tid=5715) for RS-485, I2C, 1-Wire and power connection details.

The demo application attempts to connect to a WiFi network, once connected, the system clock is synchronized over SNTP and then it will poll all four sensors at a user-defined interval (6-seconds).  As each sensor is polled the application prints the results via the serial debug port.
